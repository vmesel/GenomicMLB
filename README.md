# Machine Learning for genome Sequences Benchmark

![DNA Strands](https://support.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Pharmacy-589x277.jpg)

This algorithm was created for purposing a benchmarking tool for genomic Machine Learning running at the Laboratory of Gene Expression in Eukaryotes, Instituto Butantan. This tool can be used by anyone respecting the license and attributting the author's name on the embeded/modified source code. 
This tool can generate two types of outputs:
 - A sequence with the pattern in a random position
 - A Fasta file with random sequences and a random portion of them, have the genomic pattern

This algorithms purpose is to improve the sequencing prediction in Machine Learning algorithms such as SVM, Bayes, RandomForest and many others. This algorithm should work with deep learning too, but its not in its main focus.

## Contributing:

There are many ways you can contribute to an open source project:

 - *With bug tracking/reporting*: You can always create GitHub issues to let us know where are the bugs and how to fix them
 - *With code*: To contribute to the algorithm you must follow PEP8 rules and, after your changes, you will need to add username to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
 - *Donations*: If you would like to contribute with any money quantity, it would be very welcome. Please send a paypal donation for: vinicius@galaxianerd.com.br

## Future improvements

The future improvements are related in the Issues tab on GitHub or in the code comments where you can find #TODO.
